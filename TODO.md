# TODO

⭐means it's important to be done before the video series
😎means it's optional

- crashlog

## CCF

- right now it's not sufficient to assume either 1 or [# of orientations] if the factor to multiply by when a cycle orientations

  - 😎figure out move ordering dependence
  - F B cycle type is NOT checked!!
  - document
  - check for logs in test cases; tracing
  - hardcode the first solution moves in the test cases to be sure
- use *mut u8 instead of Box<[u8]> for generic puzzle  
- dont pack bit vector for AuxMem
- 😎replace pub(crate) with getters
- try out a different exact hasher

  - any puzzle https://github.com/cubing/twsearch/blob/main/src/cpp/index.cpp
- spam debug_assert!()
- solve for all cycle structures from CCF at once vs many runs of single cycle structure at a time
- ⭐pruning table
  - generate table during the solve
    - if the number of probes exceeds the number of set values in the table by a certain factor (3x?) it considers generating another level of the table, if there is enough memory to do so
  - cartesian product tables
    - seed only one value

  - fix storage backend initialization meta
  - approximate pruning table
    - reread this <https://discord.com/channels/@me/1399108854784065677/1431035660839555187> 
  - tANS table compression
  - cycle type pruning table
    - with fewer state spaces, go back to an exact pruning table
    - generate the cycle type table before the approximate table and roughly guess the average pruning value

  - ⭐multithreading
    - For example, for a 48-symmetric state, the search begins with the symmetry marker 48-symmetric. Before taking the first move, we determine which possible moves are possible based on the symmetry state. For this state, the first possible transitions are either U or U2; all other states are reachable through symmetry. Suppose we take U as the first move, resulting in an 8-symmetric state. Then, if we continue with this 8-symmetric state, the possible move are (R, R2, R', D, D2, D'). This approach reduces the search tree size to approximately 1/48th of its original size, and eliminates the need for specialized handling of various cases.
    - microthreading
- you NEED to account for parity constraints when calculating orbit size; address this in schreier sims
- ⭐solved state for 4x4
- ⭐antisymmetry
- 😎mulcmp3 and mul3 optimizations from twsearch
- 😎PGE
- can we use move tables? look into at the end
- Generate a pruning table starting from the scramble instead of the solved state and then began the search from the solved state
