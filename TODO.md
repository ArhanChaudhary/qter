# TODO

⭐means it's important to be done before the video series
😎means it's optional

## CCF

- right now it's not sufficient to assume either 1 or [# of orientations] if the factor to multiply by when a cycle orientations

## CCS

- solver.rs
  - given A B A B A B A C A B in order to realize that this sequence isn't valid wrt sequence symmetry you would have to look at the first move and "mp plus one" and keep incrementing both numbers as long as the moves are equal
    - should generalize to A B C A B C A B C D A B C
  - F B cycle type is NOT checked!!
  - figure out move ordering dependence
  - document
  - check for logs in test cases; tracing
  - hardcode the first solution moves in the test cases to be sure
- use *mut u8 instead of Box<[u8]> for generic puzzle

- solve for all cycle structures from CCF at once vs many runs of single cycle structure at a time
- ⭐pruning table
  - generate table during the solve
    - if the number of probes exceeds the number of set values in the table by a certain factor (3x?) it considers generating another level of the table, if there is enough memory to do so
  - cartesian product tables
    - seed only one value

  - tANS table compression

  - ⭐multithreading
    - For example, for a 48-symmetric state, the search begins with the symmetry marker 48-symmetric. Before taking the first move, we determine which possible moves are possible based on the symmetry state. For this state, the first possible transitions are either U or U2; all other states are reachable through symmetry. Suppose we take U as the first move, resulting in an 8-symmetric state. Then, if we continue with this 8-symmetric state, the possible move are (R, R2, R', D, D2, D'). This approach reduces the search tree size to approximately 1/48th of its original size, and eliminates the need for specialized handling of various cases.
    - microthreading
- you NEED to account for parity constraints when calculating orbit size; address this in schreier sims
- ⭐solved state for 4x4
- ⭐antisymmetry
- 😎mulcmp3 and mul3 optimizations from twsearch
- 😎PGE
- can we use move tables? look into at the end
- Generate a pruning table starting from the scramble instead of the solved state and then began the search from the solved state
