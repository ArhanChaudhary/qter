PROJECT STATUS: almost MVP; many features incomplete

Qter is a human-friendly Rubik's cube computer. This means you can compile a computer program and then act as a computer processor by physically turning a Rubik's cube to affect its computation, even if you have no knowledge of how computers work. Following is an example executable program that accepts user input and computes corresponding Fibonacci number iteratively, written in our custom Rubik's cube file format named Q:

This was compiled from our custom high level programming language named QAT (Qter Assembly Text):

```janet

}

.macro fib-shuffle {
    ($R1:reg $R2:reg $R3:reg $counter:reg) => {
        dec $counter
        if solved $counter {
            halt "The number is" $R1
        }
        while not-solved $R1 {
            dec $R1
            inc $R2
            inc $R3
        }
    }
}

input "Which Fibonacci number to calculate:" D
if solved D {
    halt "The number is: 0"
}
inc B

# Usage

## Physically running qter

### The Q file format

The Q file format is qter's representation of a computer program in an executable Rubik's cube language. As promised, the file format was designed in such a way that, with relatively little effort or knowledge, humans can physically manipulate a Rubik's cube to execute these programs and affect a meaningful computation.

Contrary to what was introduced, qter doesn't just work with Rubik's cubes, but with any twisty puzzle in the shape of a platonic solid. However, we are most familiar with the Rubik's cube, thus for demonstration purposes we will introduce the Q file format with the aforementioned from now on.

Q files are expected to be read from top to bottom, with labeled line numbers for visual clarity. Each line indicates an instruction, which can either be a manipulation to physically perform or an alterative logic construct on the Rubik's cube. For example:

```l
Puzzles
A: 3x3

1 | U' R2
2 | L D'
...
```

The `Puzzles` declaration specifies the types of twisty puzzles used, it being just the Rubik's cube in this case. The instructions indicate performing the moves U' R2 L D' on the Rubik's cube, given in [standard move notation](https://jperm.net/3x3/moves). You must begin with all specified puzzles solved at any angle before following the instructions.

The Q file format also permits special instructions that involve the used twisty puzzle but require additional logic. These logical instructions were designed to be simple enough for humans to understand and perform.

### Logical instructions

Following this section, you should be able to entirely understand how to physically execute the example Fibonacci program provided at the beginning of this document. More complicated instructions are expanded upon in the next section.

- `goto [number]`

<ul>
Start reading instructions from the specified line number. For example:

<pre>
Puzzles
A: 3x3

1 | U' R2
2 | L D'
3 | goto 1
...
</pre>
Indicates an infinite loop of performing U' R2 L D' on the Rubik's cube.
</ul>

- `solved-goto [number] [positions]`

<ul>
Start reading instructions from the specified line number if the specified positions on the puzzle each contain their solved piece. If not, fall through and ignore this instruction. For example:

```l
Puzzles
A: 3x3

1 | U' R2
2 | solved-goto 4 UFR UF
3 | goto 1
4 | L D'
...
```

Indicates repeatedly performing U' R2 until the UFR corner position and UB edge position contain their solved pieces, at when perform L D' on the Rubik's cube. Note that three faces uniquely identify any corner position and two faces uniquely identify any edge position on the Rubik's cube, hence UFR (up front right) and UF (up front).

Determining if a position contains its solved piece slightly varies from puzzle to puzzle, but the idea remains the same. For the Rubik's cube, this is the case when each face of the piece at the position is uniform with its center. The following illustrates a successful `solved-goto 4 UFR UF` instruction:

</ul>

- `input [message] [moves] max-input [number]`

<ul>

This instruction facilitates arbitrary input from a user which will be stored and processed on the puzzle.

What we could do is supply the algorithm for the cycle and tell the user to repeat that algorithm <their input> number of times
this is equivalent to incrementing a register value by one <their input> number of times

 incrementing by the inputted number of times

```l
Puzzles
A: 3x3

1 | input "Choose 0-5"
          R U R' U'
          max-input 5
...
```

</ul>

- `halt`

<ul>
WIP
</ul>

- `switch`

<ul>
WIP
</ul>

### Advanced instructions

The Q file format thus far is theoretically equivalent to the computational facilities of a computer, an important theorem proven in the [computer architecture](#computer-architecture) section.

- `print`

<ul>
WIP
</ul>

- `push`

<ul>
WIP
</ul>

- `pop`

<ul>
WIP
</ul>

- `switch-top`

<ul>

</ul>

## Programming qter

### Compilation pipeline

If you have experience working with a compiled programming language, you know that to run a program, you compile your source code into machine code that the computer processor then interprets and executes. The qter compilation pipeline works similarly.

### Programming language

# Design

Obligatorily, much of qter is heavily based on group theory, compiler theory, and programming language theory. The target audience of this document more reflects the lay person rather than the advanced mathematician or computer scientist, so we will provide gentle introductions to these concepts to make our design principles and the rest of this document as accessible as possible.

## Computer architecture

Qter is similar in many ways to how modern computers work, yet at the same time esoteric by nature. This section will start with a light background of how Rubik's cubes work and then elaborate on the unique properties that make qter possible.

# About the authors

- Arhan Chaudhary: Hi! I am a sophomore at Purdue University, and I have always been fascinated by Rubik's cubes since I learned how to solve them in middle school. I was greatly inspired by the [Purdue Hackers](https://www.purduehackers.com/) community to begin this project, and have spent the better part of the entire school year working on it. I'm looking for Summer 2026 internships - and I'm particularly excited about working with startups. Read more about my work at my [website](https://arhan.sh/).
